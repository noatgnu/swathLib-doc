\section{Introduction}
SWATHLib is an attempt at creating an automated workflow for creation of manually curated spectral library for SWATH downstream analysis. The program itself is composed of two main component, the front-end created using TypeScript with Electron and the Angular framework and the back-end created using Python with Tornado as the server implementation.
